# the first program should output 3 as it is repeating 0 + 1 three times
# each time implicitly returning the value of x with the 1 added
# first time is 0 + 1, next time is 1 + 1, then 2 + 1. Total is 3.

# second program should give an error. This is because x is defined
# within the scope of the block and is therefore not available outside
# of the block.
